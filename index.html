During his leisure hours, Gopalrao started teaching Anandi to read and write Marathi. He instilled in her a desire to learn more.It was common for Brahmins, in those times, to be proficient in Sanskrit. But Gopalrao influenced by Lokhitawadi’s Shat Patre, considered learning English more important.

    <li><strong>1879</strong> - Anandibai gave birth to a boy, but the child lived only for a total of ten days due to lack of medical care. This proved to be a turning point in Anandi's life and inspired her to become a physician.</li>

   <li><strong>1886</strong> - Anandibai Joshee graduated from Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (WMCP) obtaining a First Class MD degree.Later,Anandi and Gopalrao decided to return to India. When Anandi and Gopalrao reached Bombay, a grand reception was arranged to honour Anandi.

newspaper editor. I do not have a large income. Even then I wish to give you one hundred rupees”. </em></p>
